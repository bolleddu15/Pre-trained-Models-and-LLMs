## Transformers and Sequence Models 
Fine-Tuning Pre-trained Models
What is the difference between pre-training and fine-tuning in NLP? Pre-training is training a model on a large dataset for general language understanding. Fine-tuning adjusts the pre-trained model on a smaller, task-specific dataset to perform better on a specific task.

How would you approach fine-tuning a pre-trained model like GPT-3 for a specific domain, such as healthcare? Iâ€™d prepare a healthcare-specific dataset and fine-tune the model on it to improve performance on domain-specific tasks like medical report generation.

What hyperparameters would you adjust when fine-tuning a pre-trained model, and why? Learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs are critical. Lowering the learning rate prevents overwriting the pre-trained knowledge.

What challenges can arise during the fine-tuning of LLMs? How can you address them? Overfitting on small datasets is common. To address this, use techniques like regularization or fine-tuning only the top layers of the model.

How does fine-tuning improve model performance in low-resource tasks? Fine-tuning adapts the general knowledge from the pre-trained model to perform well on a specific, smaller dataset, improving task-specific performance.
