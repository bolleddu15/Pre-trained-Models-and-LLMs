## How many Image recognition algorithms are present ? 
Traditional Algorithms and Normal  algo 
Deep Learning-Based Algorithms:

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): Automatically learns spatial hierarchies of features.
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs): Often used for sequential data and image captioning tasks.
Residual Networks (ResNets): Enables deep architectures without vanishing gradient issues.
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs): Used for generating new images based on learned features.

### Difference b/w Image recognition and Pattern recognition 
hough often used interchangeably, Image Recognition and Pattern Recognition differ in their scope and application:

Image Recognition:

Primarily focuses on identifying objects, people, or specific features in images.
Involves understanding visual data at the pixel level and labeling the identified objects.
Widely used in applications like facial recognition, object detection, and scene understanding.
Pattern Recognition:

A broader concept encompassing the identification of patterns in all kinds of data (not limited to images).
Extends to speech recognition, text analysis, and financial data, alongside image data.
Works on abstract patterns, grouping similar features to classify or predict outcomes across multiple domains.

## How accuracy and prediction varies in Traditional models and Image Models? 


The accuracy and prediction capabilities vary significantly between traditional machine learning models and modern image models (deep learning):

Traditional Models:

Depend on feature engineering, where human expertise defines the relevant features (edges, textures).
Accuracy is often limited by the quality of manually extracted features.
These models struggle with complex datasets that involve high variance in shapes, orientations, and noise.
Image Models (Deep Learning):

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) automatically learn relevant features directly from raw pixel data, improving accuracy.
Perform better with large datasets and complex image structures due to deep architecture.
Prediction capabilities are more robust in handling variations like lighting, scale, and background clutter.
However, these models may require more computational resources and data to train effectively.
